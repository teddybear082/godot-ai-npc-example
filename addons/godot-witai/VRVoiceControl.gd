## This code is based on code shared by VRWorkout found here: https://github.com/mgschwan/godot_witai_voiceinterface
## License is MIT license
## This code has functions to capture the player's microphone input, then send it to wit.ai for processing of speech to text
## and then send either a pre-determined intent set in wit.ai to GPT or, if no pre-set intent is found, send the free text
## to a signal to be handled by the rest of the program.  The idea is the pre-determined intents would be common player commands or questions to the NPC that can then be
## funneled into the best possible prompt for that scenario rather than leaving everything to messier free text.
## In this demo, wit.ai's output is used as an input for a GPT-3.5-turbo query but you could use a different AI response generator instead by connecting to the signals here.  
## NOTE: For this to work you need "Enable audio input" as checked "On" in the Project Settings / Audio menu.

# Signal emitted for wit.ai defined intent that was found from speech; connecting to this signal could be used for defdined voice commands in game
signal voice_command(command)

# Signal emitted with free text that is generated either by matching free text to correspond with intent found or transcription of player speech
signal wit_ai_speech_to_text_received(text)
