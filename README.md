This uses Godot 3.5, download the project and open it in Godot 3.5.x editor. 

This is made for VR, but the GPT and wit.ai scripts found in the addons folder should hopefully be useful for everyone to adapt to their particular use case, while this demo shows how various functionalities might be connected together.

You will need to use your own wit.ai token and openAI GPT API key.
